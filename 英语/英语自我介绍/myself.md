Hi, first, thank you so much for giving me this great opportunity to have the interview with you! My name is 庹涛， and I go by Titi as well. Next, let me give you an
overview of my education background.I am currently an undergraduate student at the Harbin University of Science and technology studying Computer Science and Technology.

a little while ago,I worked at Sensetime company and my position  was  development of storage system.I have been taking in 2 roles in this job.First，my main job was to develop another client for memcache server in order to reduce the complexity of using original memcache client.In order to finish the project,we planned to intercept the system call named read by linux hook at that time，but I found a fact which was better to preprocess most of the logics by intercepting the system call named open.my leader giving me the goal was that average iops could reach 1700,but now average iops could reach 3000 through my optmization,which indicates that I am a fast learner. 
In addition,I also played a role in infrastructure so that memcache server could work normally.Main operation was that to monitor whether the memcache server still alive or not and occupancy rate of disk by open source platform zabbix.
    
From my knowledge,Tietoevry company is really competitive in IT services field.And I would be really honored if I could get this position, and I hope to use what I learned and my past work experience to help the company grow stronger in the future.
Thank you again for your time,and plaese let me know if you have any further questions.
